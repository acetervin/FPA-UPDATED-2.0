# Vercel Deployment Refactor

- [x] Create `api/index.ts` to wrap the Express app.

- [x] Update `vercel.json` for serverless builds and routing.

- [x] Update `package.json` with a build script and `@vercel/node` dependency.
- [x] Modify `server/index.ts` to export the Express app without starting the server.
